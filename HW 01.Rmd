```
**There are 32 rows, for 32 cars.**
```{r}

```

**These numbers are just the second feature column layed out, showing the number of cylinders in each car.**

```{r}
mean(mtcars$cyl)
```

**This number is the average of all those cylinders. Funky.**

```{r}
sd(mtcars$mpg)
```

**Here's the standard deviation for the miles per gallon.**

```{r}
