**This dataframe displays different features for 32 types of car.**

```{r}

```

**There are 32 rows, for 32 cars.**

```{r}

**These numbers are just the second feature column layed out, showing the number of cylinders in each car.**

```{r}

```

**This number is the average of all those cylinders. Funky.**

```{r}

```

**Here's the standard deviation for the miles per gallon.**

```{r}

```

**And here's that same number, rounded to 3 decimal places.**

```{r}
